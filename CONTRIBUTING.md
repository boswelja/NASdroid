# Contributing

We are accepting pull requests! Please follow the etiquette outlined below to avoid duplicate, discarded or ignored work:

- Check for an existing issue on [our board](https://github.com/boswelja/NASdroid/issues)
  - If an issue already exists, check whether anyone is assigned, or if there is open work
    - If there is an open pull request, review it
    - If there is someone assigned, drop them a comment asking if you can help
    - If nobody is assigned, drop a comment to see if you can pick it up
  - If no issue exists, you can create one
    - Try not to start any work until one of the team has reviewed it to make sure it's viable
- Pull request titles should briefly explain your change, for example "Updated Compose to 1.5.0"
- Pull request descriptions should include more detailed information about your change, ideally
  - Release note links for dependency updates
  - Screenshots for changed UI
