# Contributing

* Pull requests are more than welcome!
* If you plan on working on a new feature or functionality, please open an issue so we can discuss viability and implementation.
* If you want to work on an existing issue, drop a comment on the issue and (as long as there's nobody assigned already) we can assign you.
* If you're looking for something to work on, our issues board is a great place to start.

## Pull Requests and Commits

* Commit messages should essentially be sentences without periods; add the description if it makes sense to do so (sentence *with* a period). For example: `git commit -am "Commit message" -m "Commit description."`.
* Please add a PR description that clearly describes your changes, with links to relevant documentation, API references, etc.
* Pull requests are squashed, so don't worry too much about commits to branches. That said, unreadable commit messages make it hard to follow along with what you're doing.
